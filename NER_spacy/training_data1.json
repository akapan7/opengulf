The matter contained in this article on the 'Omān Sultanate, and in the articles subordinate to it, has for the most part been obtained at first hand expressly for the present Gazetteer. All information regarding the country available in published books and in official reports was first condensed by the writer into 82 foolscap pages of print, —a process which was completed in August 1904. —and the resulting volume was then forwarded to Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to Major W. Grey, Political Agent at Masqat, to serve as a basis for fresh inquiries. It was also taken by the writer himself on tour to the Gulf in the cold weather of 1904-05, when, with the assistance of Mr. J. C. Gaskin, at that time holding a political appointment under the Gulf Residency, a large quantity of new geographical material was collected; the investigations relating to Ruūs-al-Jibāl were made at Shārjah, those relating to the wastem parts of Bātinah and Hajar at Sohār, and the remainder at the town of Masqat itself, where informants for most parts of the country were easily obtained. Full information regarding Gwādar was kindly supplied in 1905 by Mr. R. Hughes-Buller, I.C.S., in charge of the Imperial Gazetteer of Balūchistān. From his own materials and from those furnished by Majors Cox and Grey and by Mr. Hughes-Buller the writer next prepared a number of draft articles which appeared in January 1906 in the form of 240 octavo pages of print and were sent to the LOC_CUSTOMal officers for revision and completion. These latter operations continued throughout the greater part of 1906, the Ruūs-al-Jibāl district being carefully dealt with by Major Cox, assisted by Khān Bahādur Abdul Latīf-bin-Abdur Rahmān, the British Agent at Shārjah, and Gwādar by Mr. H. Whitby Smith, Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs; the Kumzāri dialect was carefully investigated by Captain A. P. Trevor, Assistant Resident; and the very large quantity of matter relating to the other districts was disposed of by Major Grey, who, at the end of 1906, paid a special visit to Dhufār in order to acquaint himself with that part of the country. Major Grey's principal assistants were Yusuf Stephān, Agency dragoman, and Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Sa'īd, son of a late Wazīr of the Sultān of' Omān. On receipt of the reports of these officers a revised set of drafts, extending to about 300 pages, was prepared at Simla and was finished in February 1907; but there were still omissions to be supplied and doubts to be solved, and the work of LOC_CUSTOMal investigation was not finally brought to an end till November 1907. It will be convenient to mention here the principal authorities to which recourse may be had for information (on specific points) more detailed than is to be found in the Gazetteer. In geological matters, besides the Geological Appendix to this Gazetteer, for which the writer is indebted to Mr. Pilgrim, the following will be found useful: Newbold's Descriptive List of Rock Specimens from Maskat , 1850; Carter's Reports accompanying Copper Ore from the Island of Maseera, his Geological Observations on the Igneous Rocks of Maskat , 1850; and his Memoir on the 'Geology of the South-East Coast of Arabia , 1852. The subject of medical topography is handled by Dr. Peter in his Medico-Topographical Account of Maskat , 1875, and by Surgeon-Major Jayakar in his Medical Topography of Maskat , 1877. The only work dealing expressly with the botany of the country is Aucher-Éley's Relations de Voyages en Orient , 1843; but oooasional remarks on flora are made by Colonel Miles in some of his papers mentioned below. In the present connection we may refer to Carter's Description of the Frankincense Tree of Arabia. The frankincense trade is dealt with in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for March 1905. The chief treatises on tribal matters are Colonel Ross's Report on the Tribes of Oman , 1872, and Colonel Miles' Note on the Tribes of Oman , 1881; but the information which they contain is generally superseded by that now given in the Gazetteer. Carter, however, has tome interesting Notes on the Ghara (i.e., Qara) Tribe , 1845, and a continuation of the same , 1847, which may still be perused with advantage. Turning to geography, we find the literature of that subject reviewed by Colonel Miles in his Memorandum, on the Geography of Oman , 1879; and Arabia , 1900, by the Rev. S. M. Zwemer contains a short account of the 'Omān Sultanate as a whole. The Persian Gulf Pilot , 1898, and the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot , 1900, deal completely and systematically with the entire coast and give details relating to navigation with a fulness which would be out of place in a political Gazetteer: the two overlap on the Arabian coast between Sūr and Rās-al-Hadd. More restricted in their scope, but still each relating to more than one district of the 'Omān Sultanate, are the books, articles and reports by Wellsted, Aucher-Éloy, Ward and others, Cole, Colonel Miles, Captain Dowding and Major Cox which are specified and partially analysed in the paragraph on communications in the present article: among these are some of the most important contributions which we possess towards a knowledge of the geography of the Sultanate. WhiteLOC_CUSTOMk's Descriptive Sketch , 1838, and Goldsmid's Telegraph and Travel , 1874, deal partially with the Ruūs-al-Jibāl district; but more recent and full is a letter by Major Cox (No. 290 of the 2nd July 1902) in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for November 1902; Burchardt's Out-Arabien von Basra bis Maskat , 1906, is useful also, and contains photographs. The Bātinah district is described in Pengelley's Remarks on a Portion of the Eastern Coast of Arabia between Muscat and Sohar; and Stiffe has left an account of Wādi Bōshar in his Visit to the Hot Springs of Bosher. Carter's Geographical Description of Certain Parts of the South-East Coast of Arabia , 1851, deals with the entire littoral between Masqat Town and the extreme western end of the Dhufār District; while Haines' Memoir of the South and East Coasts of Arabia covers the same stretch, except the part between Masqat Town and Sūr, which is omitted. The Kuria Muria islands are the subject of more thun one monograph, viz., Hulton's Notice on the Kuria Muria Islands, Whish's Descriptive Sketch of the Island of Jibbleea, Dawson's Geography and Meteorology of the Kuria Muria Islands, and Buist's Kuria Muria Islands, all of these being papers which appeared between 1840 and 1860. Colonel Miles Report on a Visit to Dhofar , 1883, and his Visit of the Political Agent, Muscat, to Ras Fartak , 1884, are partly concerned with the Sooth-Eastern Coast of 'Omān, the Kuria Muria Islands, etc., and partly with the District of Dhufār; but Cruttenden's Journal of an Excursion from Morebat to Dyreez, Mr. T. Bent's Exploration of the Frankincense Country and his Land of Frankincense and Myrrh , 1895, and the chapters XVIII to XXI of Mrs. Bent's Southern Arabia , 1900, refer altogether to Dhufār . Trade is dealt with in the annual Administration and Commercial Reports of the Persian Gulf Residency. The antiquities and ancient geography of the 'Omān Sultanate have not as yet received much attention. Besides Mrs. Bent's Southern Arabia already mentioned, it only remains to cite under this heading Carter's Descriptive Account of the Ruins of El Balad , 1846, Colonel Miles' Note on Pliny's Geography of the East Coast of Arabia , 1878, and Stiffe's Ancient Trading Centres of the Persian Gulf— Maskat , 1897. To this account of the chief sources of information we may subjoin, for the convenience of the student, a list of the most useful maps and charts in which the dominions of the Sultan of 'Omān appear. The most serviceable map including the whole Sultanate has hitherto been Parts of Arabia and Persia , 1883; but it is now superseded by the map, on the same scale, which is issued with the present Gazetteer. Another comprehensive map of the Sultanate is one by Colonel Ross entitled Map of' Omān showing the Distribution of the Principal Tribes , 1901. Chart No. 2873-2837 A. of the Persian Gulf gives the whole coast from the Ruūs-al-Jibāl district to Quryāt village inclusive; No. 2369—10C. of the North-East Coast of Arabia, partially overlapping the last, extends from Khadhra in Bātinah to Rās Sauqirah on the South-Eastern Coast of 'Omān; and No. 2365—1012 of the Arabian Sea, also overlapping its predecessor, reaches from Rās-al-Hadd to Aden. The foregoing are general maps and charts, and we pass now to others which represent smaller tracts, but usually upon a larger scale. The coast and hills of Ruūs-al Jibāl are shown in Chart No. 2375—753, Entrance of the Persian Gulf and those of the Masqat District and Eastern Hajar Coast in Chart No. 2383-38, Maskat to Karachi. A Sketch Map showing the Boundary between the' Omān Sultanate and Trucial 'Omān near Murair , 1905, gives some of the topographical details in the vicinity indicated; and a plan known as the Environs of Sohār , 1905, is sufficiently described by its name; both of these were prepared for the Gazetteer by Surveyor Jamna Parshad, and they have been filed in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla, as No. 1363 and No. 1362, respectively. Black's Sketch of the Batinah Coast , 1874, shows approximately the positions of all villages in that district east of Makhailīf. The Indian Survey Sheets Maskat District and Maskat and Matrah, are both the result of surveys undertaken in 1904-05 in connection with the Gazetteer operations. Admiralty Plan No. 2372-2869, Maskat and Al Matra, covers much the same ground as the last mentioued map, but with less attention to detail except upon the sea. The following are of the highest value in connection with the geography of the interior: — Compass Sketch of part of the Route taken by Major P. Z. Cox from Abu Dhabi to Maskat , 1902, extending across the districts of Dhāhirah and' OmānProper, the map containrd in Wellsted's book Travels in Arabia , 1838, embracing several districts; and the Sketch Map of the Country round Sur , 1903, covering the part of the Eastern Hajar District between Jaalān and the northern coast.
