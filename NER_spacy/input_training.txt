ABADILAH

عبادله

Singular Abduli عبدولي: a tribe of Trucial Oman who have 200 houses at Sharjah. Town, 20 at Ghallah in Shamailiyah , and 15 at Khalaibiyah adjoining Wadi Ham; some of them are found also as settlers on Shaikh Shuaib island. In all they may number about 1200 souls. In politics they are Ghafiris, and in religion Hanbali Sunnis. They are not connected with the Sharqiyin, and they claim, it is said, to be Shurafa from Makkah. Another account assimilates them to the Obaidli tribe of the Shibkuh district in Persia, deriving them from the Abdah branch of the Shammar of Najd ; it is possible that this theory has no foundation except in the partial resemblance of the names.

ABBADAN
(1430 words)
عبادان


Also called Jazirat-al-Khidhar1جزيرة الخضر from a shrine near its centre, is a large and valuable island enclosed by the Karun river on the north, by the Shatt-al-Arab on the west, by the Persian Gulf on the south, and by the Bahmaushir on the east. Its length is about 40 miles, and its width varies from about 1½ miles at the middle to 12 miles near its southern end. The centre is mostly desert, but the margins adjoining the rivers, as far as creeks extend inland, are cultivated and planted with dates: much land is now being reclaimed in the Maamareh neighbourhood near the south end. A submarine prolongation of the island into the Persian Gulf forms the great reef called Maraqqat Abbadan مرقّة عباّدان .

The inhabitants of Abbadan are almost all Kaab Arabs, of the Dris division of the tribe, and those in the southern part of the island nearly all belong to the Nassar subdivision.

A considerable tract in the north-eastern corner of the island is known by the name of Maharzi محرزي; its limits are at Shakhat-al-Hayak on the northern, and at Huz Umar on the eastern shore of the island.

The shrine of Khidhar2 stands a little nearer to the north than to the south end of the island, about 2 miles from the Shatt-al- Arab and I mile from the Bahmanshir: it is largely visited by the Shriahs of the surrounding districts.

We proceed to give a list of the villages with which the shores of Abbadan are studded:—

Villages on the south coast of Abbadan island.

The sea coast appears to be fairly firm and well marked, but there are no fixed villages, only temporary huts used by shepherds.

The total population of the island appears to be about 24000 souls.

The two southern administrative divisions of Abbadan, which is itself included in the Muhammareh District of Southern Arabistan, are Manyuhi and Qasbat-an-Nassar; in each of the villages bearing these names there is a representative of the Shaikh of Muhammareh. The part of the island north of Manyuhi was formerly under the chief Shaikh of the Dris Kaab, but it is now in charge of the Shaikh of the Ahl-al- Aryadh Muhaisin.

The principal town of Qasim and in fact of all Najd ; it is situated about 150 miles south-east by east of Hail , 200 miles north-west of Riyadh and 12 miles south of Buraidah . It is thus about half way between Basrah and Makkah, being distant about 400 miles from either, and lies nearly in the straight line, and not far from midway, between the capitals of Northern and Southern Najd . With good reason it is regarded by its inhabitants as being the centre of the whole Arabian peninsula and is styled by them Umm Najd أمّ نجد or "Mother of Central Arabia."

Notes
1. Both names are in common use.

2. Muhammadan theologians are not agreed whether this mysterious personage is a prophet or not. Some of them even deny his existence; but there are, on the other hand, Sufi mystics who affirm that they have seen him. He is believed to have existed in the time of Abraham, to have been a companion of Moses, and to be still alive in consequence of having drunk of the water of life. Some Muhammadan commentators identify him with the prophet Elias, others with Saint George of England: one even makes him a general in the army of Alexander the Great.

3. The matter contained in this article on the 'Omān Sultanate, and in the articles subordinate to it, has for the most part been obtained at first hand expressly for the present Gazetteer. All information regarding the country available in published books and in official reports was first condensed by the writer into 82 foolscap pages of print, —a process which was completed in August 1904. —and the resulting volume was then forwarded to Major P. Z. Cox, Resident in the Persian Gulf, and to Major W. Grey, Political Agent at Masqat, to serve as a basis for fresh inquiries. It was also taken by the writer himself on tour to the Gulf in the cold weather of 1904-05, when, with the assistance of Mr. J. C. Gaskin, at that time holding a political appointment under the Gulf Residency, a large quantity of new geographical material was collected; the investigations relating to Ruūs-al-Jibāl were made at Shārjah, those relating to the wastem parts of Bātinah and Hajar at Sohār, and the remainder at the town of Masqat itself, where informants for most parts of the country were easily obtained. Full information regarding Gwādar was kindly supplied in 1905 by Mr. R. Hughes-Buller, I.C.S., in charge of the Imperial Gazetteer of Balūchistān. From his own materials and from those furnished by Majors Cox and Grey and by Mr. Hughes-Buller the writer next prepared a number of draft articles which appeared in January 1906 in the form of 240 octavo pages of print and were sent to the local officers for revision and completion. These latter operations continued throughout the greater part of 1906, the Ruūs-al-Jibāl district being carefully dealt with by Major Cox, assisted by Khān Bahādur Abdul Latīf-bin-Abdur Rahmān, the British Agent at Shārjah, and Gwādar by Mr. H. Whitby Smith, Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs; the Kumzāri dialect was carefully investigated by Captain A. P. Trevor, Assistant Resident; and the very large quantity of matter relating to the other districts was disposed of by Major Grey, who, at the end of 1906, paid a special visit to Dhufār in order to acquaint himself with that part of the country. Major Grey's principal assistants were Yusuf Stephān, Agency dragoman, and Saiyid Muhammad-bin-Sa'īd, son of a late Wazīr of the Sultān of' Omān. On receipt of the reports of these officers a revised set of drafts, extending to about 300 pages, was prepared at Simla and was finished in February 1907; but there were still omissions to be supplied and doubts to be solved, and the work of local investigation was not finally brought to an end till November 1907. It will be convenient to mention here the principal authorities to which recourse may be had for information (on specific points) more detailed than is to be found in the Gazetteer. In geological matters, besides the Geological Appendix to this Gazetteer, for which the writer is indebted to Mr. Pilgrim, the following will be found useful: Newbold's Descriptive List of Rock Specimens from Maskat, 1850; Carter's Reports accompanying Copper Ore from the Island of Maseera, his Geological Observations on the Igneous Rocks of Maskat, 1850; and his Memoir on the 'Geology of the South-East Coast of Arabia, 1852. The subject of medical topography is handled by Dr. Peter in his Medico-Topographical Account of Maskat, 1875, and by Surgeon-Major Jayakar in his Medical Topography of Maskat, 1877. The only work dealing expressly with the botany of the country is Aucher-Éley's Relations de Voyages en Orient, 1843; but oooasional remarks on flora are made by Colonel Miles in some of his papers mentioned below. In the present connection we may refer to Carter's Description of the Frankincense Tree of Arabia. The frankincense trade is dealt with in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for March 1905. The chief treatises on tribal matters are Colonel Ross's Report on the Tribes of Oman, 1872, and Colonel Miles' Note on the Tribes of Oman, 1881; but the information which they contain is generally superseded by that now given in the Gazetteer. Carter, however, has tome interesting Notes on the Ghara (i.e., Qara) Tribe, 1845, and a continuation of the same, 1847, which may still be perused with advantage. Turning to geography, we find the literature of that subject reviewed by Colonel Miles in his Memorandum, on the Geography of Oman, 1879; and Arabia, 1900, by the Rev. S. M. Zwemer contains a short account of the 'Omān Sultanate as a whole. The Persian Gulf Pilot, 1898, and the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, 1900, deal completely and systematically with the entire coast and give details relating to navigation with a fulness which would be out of place in a political Gazetteer: the two overlap on the Arabian coast between Sūr and Rās-al-Hadd. More restricted in their scope, but still each relating to more than one district of the 'Omān Sultanate, are the books, articles and reports by Wellsted, Aucher-Éloy, Ward and others, Cole, Colonel Miles, Captain Dowding and Major Cox which are specified and partially analysed in the paragraph on communications in the present article: among these are some of the most important contributions which we possess towards a knowledge of the geography of the Sultanate. Whitelock's Descriptive Sketch, 1838, and Goldsmid's Telegraph and Travel, 1874, deal partially with the Ruūs-al-Jibāl district; but more recent and full is a letter by Major Cox (No. 290 of the 2nd July 1902) in the Government of India's Foreign Proceedings for November 1902; Burchardt's Out-Arabien von Basra bis Maskat, 1906, is useful also, and contains photographs. The Bātinah district is described in Pengelley's Remarks on a Portion of the Eastern Coast of Arabia between Muscat and Sohar; and Stiffe has left an account of Wādi Bōshar in his Visit to the Hot Springs of Bosher. Carter's Geographical Description of Certain Parts of the South-East Coast of Arabia, 1851, deals with the entire littoral between Masqat Town and the extreme western end of the Dhufār District; while Haines' Memoir of the South and East Coasts of Arabia covers the same stretch, except the part between Masqat Town and Sūr , which is omitted. The Kuria Muria islands are the subject of more thun one monograph, viz., Hulton's Notice on the Kuria Muria Islands, Whish's Descriptive Sketch of the Island of Jibbleea, Dawson's Geography and Meteorology of the Kuria Muria Islands, and Buist's Kuria Muria Islands , all of these being papers which appeared between 1840 and 1860. Colonel Miles Report on a Visit to Dhofar, 1883, and his Visit of the Political Agent, Muscat, to Ras Fartak, 1884, are partly concerned with the Sooth-Eastern Coast of 'Omān , the Kuria Muria Islands, etc., and partly with the District of Dhufār ; but Cruttenden's Journal of an Excursion from Morebat to Dyreez, Mr. T. Bent's Exploration of the Frankincense Country and his Land of Frankincense and Myrrh, 1895, and the chapters XVIII to XXI of Mrs. Bent's Southern Arabia, 1900, refer altogether to Dhufār . Trade is dealt with in the annual Administration and Commercial Reports of the Persian Gulf Residency. The antiquities and ancient geography of the 'Omān Sultanate have not as yet received much attention. Besides Mrs. Bent's Southern Arabia already mentioned, it only remains to cite under this heading Carter's Descriptive Account of the Ruins of El Balad, 1846, Colonel Miles' Note on Pliny's Geography of the East Coast of Arabia, 1878, and Stiffe's Ancient Trading Centres of the Persian Gulf— Maskat, 1897. To this account of the chief sources of information we may subjoin, for the convenience of the student, a list of the most useful maps and charts in which the dominions of the Sultan of 'Omān appear. The most serviceable map including the whole Sultanate has hitherto been Parts of Arabia and Persia, 1883; but it is now superseded by the map, on the same scale, which is issued with the present Gazetteer. Another comprehensive map of the Sultanate is one by Colonel Ross entitled Map of' Omān showing the Distribution of the Principal Tribes, 1901. Chart No. 2873-2837 A. of the Persian Gulf gives the whole coast from the Ruūs-al-Jibāl district to Quryāt village inclusive; No. 2369—10C. of the North-East Coast of Arabia, partially overlapping the last, extends from Khadhra in Bātinah to Rās Sauqirah on the South-Eastern Coast of 'Omān ; and No. 2365—1012 of the Arabian Sea, also overlapping its predecessor, reaches from Rās-al-Hadd to Aden. The foregoing are general maps and charts, and we pass now to others which represent smaller tracts, but usually upon a larger scale. The coast and hills of Ruūs-al Jibāl are shown in Chart No. 2375—753, Entrance of the Persian Gulf and those of the Masqat District and Eastern Hajar Coast in Chart No. 2383-38, Maskat to Karachi. A Sketch Map showing the Boundary between the' Omān Sultanate and Trucial 'Omān near Murair, 1905, gives some of the topographical details in the vicinity indicated; and a plan known as the Environs of Sohār, 1905, is sufficiently described by its name; both of these were prepared for the Gazetteer by Surveyor Jamna Parshad, and they have been filed in the Library of the Foreign Department, Simla, as No. 1363 and No. 1362, respectively. Black's Sketch of the Batinah Coast, 1874, shows approximately the positions of all villages in that district east of Makhailīf. The Indian Survey Sheets Maskat District and Maskat and Matrah, are both the result of surveys undertaken in 1904-05 in connection with the Gazetteer operations. Admiralty Plan No. 2372-2869, Maskat and Al Matra, covers much the same ground as the last mentioued map, but with less attention to detail except upon the sea. The following are of the highest value in connection with the geography of the interior:— Compass Sketch of part of the Route taken by Major P. Z. Cox from Abu Dhabi to Maskat, 1902, extending across the districts of Dhāhirah and' OmānProper, the map containrd in Wellsted's book Travels in Arabia, 1838, embracing several districts; and the Sketch Map of the Country round Sur, 1903, covering the part of the Eastern Hajar District between Jaalān and the northern coast. Chart No. 11, Khorya Morya Bay and Islands, contains only the Kuria Muria Islands and the adjacent shore from Rās Sharbatāt to Rās Nūs. The only map of Dhufār is that contained in Mrs. Bent's book Southern Arabia, 1900; the Chart is No. 10 B. Gwādar District and Town appear in Chart No. 2383—38, Maskat to Karachi, and in Sheet No. 16 N.-E. of the North-Western Frontier series of the Survey of India.

ASHRAF

اشراف


Singular Sharif شريف: there is also a plural Shurafa شرفا. A sacred or semi-sacred tribe, tracing their origin to the Hijaz province and claiming kinship with the prophet Muhammad through descent from the Imam Hasan; they are found in small numbers at various points in Arabia and in the Persian Gulf region, as for instance at Naam in the district of Hariq , and possibly at Sabhah in Widyan Dawasir. Some who live atLailah in Aflaj belong to a section called Saqar سقر, while others at Saih in the same district are Hamidحامد .

WARBAH

وربه

[return to Geographical Dictionary terms]

An island lying between the north end of Bubiyan island and the mainland of TurkishIraq. It is enclosed by Khor Abdullah coming from the south-east and Khor-as-Sabiyah coming from the south, which, breaking into two channels each, meet around it, while from opposite its west end the inlet on which stands Umm Qasr runs off in a north-westerly direction. Warbah is about 8 miles long north-east and south-west, and is shaped like a crescent with its cavity towards the south; its greatest breadth is over 2 miles. The surface is flat and sandy with low serubby bushes; the general level is about 10 feet above high water; at the south-west corner the ground is a, steep slope and there is deep water close in shore.1 The channels surrounding Warbah are described in the articles, on Khor Abdullah, Umm Qasr and Khor-as-Sabiyah.

An important town on the Persian Coast at the entrance of the Persian Gulf; it constitutes in itself an administrative district and is surrounded, except on the south side which is to the sea, by the district of Shamil. Bandar Abbas is situated about 280 miles north-northwest of Masqat and 96 miles east-north-east of Lingeh Town.

A term Afar عفار, frequently used in connection with the Awamir, appears to denote a portion of the tribe inhabiting a particular territory, called Afar or Dhafrahضفره, between Mahōt and Dhufar ; it includes representatives of many sections.

A branch of the Al Subaih section of the BaniKhalid tribe, found in Qatar and Bahrain: in the former they have 400 houses at Wakrah , and in the latter 75 houses at Askar and 20 at Muharraq Town. In religion they are Maliki Sunnis. The Al Bu Ainain gain their livelihood as pearl-divers, pearl-merchants and boatmen. None of them are pastoral; but a proportion, though smaller than in the case of the other settled tribes of Qatar , live in tents in the interior during part of the cold season.

Singular Ammari عمّاري. A comparatively poor, seafaring tribe of Bahrain and Qatar , by some supposed to belong to the Ammar division of the Dawasir of Najd. In Bahrain the Amamarah have 40 houses at Muharraq Town and 100 at Budaiya; in Qatar they have 20 at Dōhah and 20 at Wakrah. Their total number may be about 900 souls. They are Maliki Sunnis by religion and live by pearl diving and by navigation in all parts of the Persian Gulf. They are closely connected with the Al Bu Kuwarah and Ma adhid and originally came to Bahrain from Qatar along with the Utub . At present they have feuds with the Al Bin-Ali and with the Al Bahaih section of the Al Morrah .

A term sometimes applied by mariners to the entire coastal region between the towns of Kuwait and Qatif in Eastern Arabia. Bedouins, however, seem to be unaware of any such general application of the name; and among them, as among the settled population of the Kuwait Principality also, the term Adan is only understood as referring to the small tract near Kuwait Town which is described in this Gazetteer under the title Adan .

A remarkable isolated hill, five miles west of the village of Safwan , on the frontier between Turkish Iraq and Kuwait. It is one mile long from north to south, half a mile in breadth and covers a lozenge-shaped space; its height is 430 feet and its summit commands an excellent view of the flat, featureless country by which it is surrounded. The hill first becomes visible from the south near the southern end of Batih, at a distance of about 39 miles: it can also be seen from three miles beyond Umm Qasr to the east-south-east. The Batin passes about 15 miles west of Jabal Sanam.

In Arabic and Persian Subba صبّا: singular Sabi صابي. The Sabians are a remarkable people dispersed in small communities over parts of Turkish Iraq and Persian Arabistan, but united everywhere by the possession of a common religion. In Arabistan they claim a Syrian origin and say that their ancestors formerly owned most of Shushtar, and they have also a tradition that many of them were once massacred at Cham-as-Sabi.

A range of mountains in the Jabal Shammar principality and one of the chief physical features of northern Najd ; it bounds the Batn plain in which Hail stands on the north-west, being interposed between Batn and the Nafud and divided from the latter by a strip of hard gravelly ground in places 2 hours wide. The length of Aja is about 75 miles,1 its breadth is about 15, and its general direction is from north-east to south-west. Its elevation is fairly constant and about 1000 feet above the surrounding plains, but one peak (jabal Fara فرع ) immediately to the west of Hail is 5, 550 feet high2 and so rises fully 2000 feet above the town. There are no subordinate ranges or spurs of importance. The material of Jabal Aja is a coarse-grained granite of grey, pink or reddish-brown colour; the strata are inclined to the horizon at an angle of 55°; and the sides of the hills, in places vertical, are generally so steep that the number of points from which they can be ascended is limited. Wells and springs abound; the hills bear brushwood and, in valleys where there is water, fine palms; there is also a tree, resembling a tamarisk in appearance, which yields gum mastic ajid is perhaps the Talh. A species of wild goat is found. Snow is seen, but not often; upon Jabal Aja.

A village on the coast of the Ruus-al-Jibal District in the Oman Sultanate; the mountains rise behind it at a distance of about 1½ miles. It consists of about 450 houses of Shihuh , nearly all of the Bani Shatair, but a few of the BaniHadiyah section, and is situated in Dibah bay about 1 mile north of Hisn-ad-Dibah حصن الدبه or Dihah proper, but it is sometimes regarded as a part of Dibah . From the sea the two places appear to form one town with a background of date palms, but in reality they are separated by a watercourse up which the sea runs for about 200 yards. The inhabitants live by date-cultivation and fishing and own about 14 sea-going Sambuks which carry dates and fish to Masqat Town and places in the Persian Gulf. A little wheat, barley and sweet potato is grown both in the date gardens and behind the town, and dates are exported. There is one provision shop kept by a Persian. Baiah is the southernmost village in Ruus-al-Jibal on the eastern side of the Oman Promontory, but it is controlled by a Shaikh appointed from Kumzar .

Preity Zinta (born 1975) is an Indian film actress. She has appeared in Hindi films of Bollywood, as well as Telugu and English-language movies. After graduating with a degree in criminal psychology, Zinta made her acting debut in Dil Se in 1998 followed by a role in Soldier the same year. These performances earned her a Filmfare Best Female Debut Award, and she was later recognised for her role as a teenage single mother in Kya Kehna (2000). She subsequently played a variety of character types, and in doing so has been credited with changing the image of a Hindi film heroine. Zinta received her first Filmfare Best Actress Award in 2003 for her performance in the drama Kal Ho Naa Ho. She went on to play the lead female role in two consecutive annual top-grossing films in India: the science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, her biggest commercial success, and the star-crossed romance Veer-Zaara, which earned her critical acclaim.
